# Job Search Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL)

This project focuses on extracting job search data using the RapidAPI job search API, performing data transformation, and loading it into an S3 bucket and Redshift database. The ETL process is divided into separate files: `etl.py` for extraction, transformation, and loading, and `util.py` for utility functions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Requests library: `pip install requests`
- Pandas library: `pip install pandas`
- Boto3 library: `pip install boto3`
- Dotenv library: `pip install python-dotenv`
- OpenAI library: `pip install openai`

Additionally, you will need the following:

- RapidAPI API key: Obtain an API key from the RapidAPI website.
- AWS credentials: Set up your AWS credentials to access S3 and Redshift services.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

2. Install the required dependencies using the provided instructions in the "Prerequisites" section.

3. Set up your RapidAPI API key and AWS credentials:

   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
   - Add your RapidAPI API key to the `.env` file:
     ```
     RAPIDAPI_API_KEY=your_rapidapi_api_key
     ```
   - Configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI or by setting environment variables:
     ```
     export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id
     export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key
     export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=your_aws_default_region
     ```

4. Update the necessary configurations in the code:

   - Modify the `url` variable in `etl.py` to match the RapidAPI job search API URL.
   - Adjust other parameters such as query parameters, headers, and data processing as per your requirements.

5. Run the ETL script:

   ```
   python etl.py
   ```

   This will initiate the data extraction, transformation, and loading into the S3 bucket and Redshift database.

6. Review the console output for any errors or successful completion messages.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `etl.py`: The main script that performs the extraction, transformation, and loading operations.
- `util.py`: Contains utility functions used by the ETL process.
- `.env`: The environment file to store your RapidAPI API key.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `README.md`: The project's README file providing an overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies.
